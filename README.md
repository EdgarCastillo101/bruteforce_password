## What's Bruteforce password?
In cryptography, a brute-force attack entails an attacker sending a large number of codes or passphrases in the hopes of correctly guessing a combination. The user can go through all of the alternative passwords and passphrases in order to find the right one. Personal note: i've created this prgram for educational purpose as i was interested on how can a program could detect the correct password.
Thank you!
